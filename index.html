<h2>JUSTICE FOR RANSOM</h2>
<p>Charlie Ackroyd opened his eyes, only to once again greet the baroness of the small room he had become so familiar with recently. Now, usually, he would immediately react in a panicked tone and maybe shed a few tears, but at this time of night, his brain only understood about a good 10% of what was going on. Which was barely enough to see the tall lean figure perching his foot on the wall in the corner of his eye. Starting to understand again, he could only think a tired “What does he want this time?” 



    The man in front of him was a specimen who could only be described with the word ‘extra.’ 
    
    He stood at a large 6’3 frame with clothes reminiscent of a waiter on a doomed high-class voyage from Southampton to New York City, his shoes being pointy enough to stab you in the chin if he ever decided to do an Irish jig 2 feet away from you, and claim powdered sugar was  magically delicious. He sported blonde lochs-aplenty reaching his checked belt. It seemed as though every time Charlie saw the man he was wearing something even more ridiculous than before, this week's special was a red, white, and blue Hawaiian flower necklace and a white fedora with a light red band. 
    
    Or rather, the boy in front of him.
    
    
    
    “Hey, sleepy.” He grimaced, cringing. “Sorry bout the recent… influx in requests.” He said looking ashamedly to the left.  Feeling awkward as usual, he tried to change the subject. “So… how’s the ca-” 
    
    
    
    “Cut the crap, Pietro.” Charlie barked, as a new influx in backbone and adrenaline tried to make up for his out-of-whack circadian rhythm. 
    
    “Alright, alright!” Pietro replied, putting his hands up defensively. 
    
    
    
    “Whaddya need?” Charlie replied, almost instinctively, the usual fear finally quelling up. 
    
    
    
    “Ah, you’re cooperating now.”
    
    Charlie mumbled something under his breath.
    
    “It’s Jack.”
    
    Charlie would roll his eyes if he had any current sense of direction, he didn’t know why they still had that kid if he gets caught almost the majority of the time.  Jack's existence made Charlie thankful he had not actually gone to court and defended yet, although if the kid kept that up, that would change. 
    
    
    
    “What’d he do this time?” Charlie inquired.
    
    “Bank, local, seen by five guards, wore a bad disguise.”
    
    “How long will it take?” Charlie anxiously replied, nervous about the answer.
    
    “About a week if you wanna get rid of the concrete stuff, extra 2 for circumstantial,” Pietro said, in an apologetic tone. “Sorry, man.”
    
    Charlie wanted to snap back with something like “You mean for this, or for kidnapping me and holding me ransom?” but he knew that answer, while it may amuse Pietro, would enrage his father, which would not be good for anyone involved, assuming Jack is still alive at this point. So, he kept quiet and sighed as Pietro made the usual hand motion to the man on the other end of the glass window, and everything went black.
    
    
    
    Chapter 2
    
    Float Like A Danifly, Sting Like A Bee
    
    It had been almost a month since Dani last saw her brother. Almost a month after his (hopefully) final graduation. Her mother was still distraught, her sister still apathetic, and her cat still… cat.
