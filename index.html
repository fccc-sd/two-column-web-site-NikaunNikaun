 <p>Maybe, just maybe, if Charlie Ackroyd didn't answer that phone call, he would be free..</p>
<br>
<br>


<p> Justice For Ransom follows recent law school graduate Charlie Ackroyd and his family. You see, shortly after graduating Charlie scheduled an interview with one Bateman Exports Company to be part of their legal team. Wow, things are looking up for him, aren't they?
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>WRONG!</em></strong>
<br>
<br>
<p> it turns out Bateman Exports Company was a front for the mafia! (Which Charlie probably should have expected given the frankly suspiciously vague name of the coorperation.) 
Not only that, but he's been kidnapped and held for ransom by them too, forced to be their lawyer, but he's not their only one... </p>
<br>
Most of the mafia members who carry out the crimes are also kidnapping victims, they include:
<ul>
 <li> Kelly O'Malley: Stern and straight-laced, Kelly focuses on trying to make each job as effecient as possible, but she makes an effort to minimize civilian casualties 
        and has a softspot for animals and her twin brother, outside of the gang's big jobs, she is the company's main treasurer, though that mostly entails a lot of (reluctant, given her past of being an accountant,) tax fraud.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Kenny O'Malley: Kelly's aforementioned twin brother, while appearence wise he simply looks like a male version of Kelly, he has the opposite personality. Kenny is consistently manic
         and pumped no matter the circumstance, theatrical and brutally honest (one of the few traits he shares with his sister), Kenny is the most acrobatic of the group and is their go-to guy for
          tight spaces and other movement-sensetive missions, Kenny loves his sister, who despite her otherwise prickly nature, is the only one capable of talking one on one with him for more than 10 minutes
           without getting a migrane. Technically, on paper, he is the company's head of janitorial services. Jointly, he and his sister share a $400,000 ransom.</li>
        <br>
    <li> Reiji Erikson-Tenya: The muscle, gentle giant Reiji is a Japanese-Canadian man who firmly believes actions speak louder than words. He is deeply spiritual in his free-time,
         and that coupled with his soft-voice makes everyone assume anything he does say is an abstract metaphor, when he actually tends to speak reasonably casually when he does decide to speak, though that's not to say
        he never offers wisdom. He is also consistently the member of the group who knows the most about seemingly otherwise random and useless knowledge that always ends up useful in very specefic circumstances, 
        and also posesses physical skills of a similar nature, like juggling. He is also,
         despite how detrimental this is to a man who consistently participates in heists and (unfortunately) hates asking for help, actively narcoleptic. 
        Despite this, he is technically listed as the head of security officially. Nobody knows his ransom, as he's never told anyone, and whenever abnyone tries to ask, they are interrupted</li>
        <br>
        <li>Jodie Osman: The most bubbly and friendly of the gang (Other than Kenny, who honestly borders more on insanity than bubbliness,) Jodie functions most often as the gang's weapon's dealer, being an inventor and all, 
            she even has a patent! Though nobody really uses the "all-fruit peeler" honestly, especially not since THE INCIDENT. Despite her status as a social butterfly, she is not the group's designated person for disguise and recon, 
        making the one who is pretty much the only person in the world who she actively and vocally dislikes, but we'll get to him. To get back on topic, there is one important note on Jodie,
    she views her inventions as her children and it woould do you good to <strong> NEVER, EVER, MESS WITH HER CHILDREN,</strong> <em>or else.</em>  Officially, she is listed as the Head of Product Development and harbors a $600,000 dollar reward.  </li>
    <br>
    <li>Jack Mancer: The aforementioned recon agent and supposed "master of disguise", despite being an abysmal actor. No one in the group even knows why he is even still used in missions or hasn't been SEVERELY punished yet. 
        As such, he is not only disliked by Jodie, but by the entire gang, with the only exception being Reiji, who is, even still, only indifferent towards him. Charlie's best guess on why he's here is that it's because
        he's also a talented artist, and is the one to draw out visual representations of the plan during mission breifings, but even that doesn't explain why he's brought along physically, or why he's
        alyways chosen for recon and disguises. Even more bizarrely, he has a collosal ransom of $10,000,000! When questioned on why, even the higher-ups seem to be clueless, and Jack himself's best guess
        is because his uncle "owned a buisness once." Officially, he's head of HR. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> 
    Pietro Venner: Son of the terrifying big-man in charge, Dimitri Venner. Pietro is the epitome of the word "extra", the official leader of the gang, most of them seem to be weirdly chummy with him, Charlie still hates him,
    and suspects that it's Stockholm Syndrome. Pietro seems to have a self-esteem and cocky attitude only rivaled by the average CEO of a pyramid scheme, or at least, that's the image he projects. Weirdly, he seems genuinely
    sorry for the gang's situation and responds pitifully to any criticism. Despite what one might expect due to his apparent  narcicissm, his opinion of other people seems to only be slightly worse on average, 
    and he spends a significant amount of his day genuinely complementing people (except Jack, of course), so much so that even Charlie thinks he's being honest on that front. Despite his habit of rushing into 
    danger with reckless abandon, he turns into a sniveling, voice-cracking, quivering mess at the sight of his father, and for good reason. Being Dimitri's son, Pietro is the only member of the gang who was not kidnapped
    and has no ransom, he's marked down as PR manager.
    <br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <p> Every other chapter deals with Charlie's family, his sweet, martial-artst mother Janet, who is putting on a brave face, his heartbroken imaginative foodie sister Dani, his other sister Skye, who has shut herself off from the world upon his disseperance
        but supports her mother as much as she can, and their perpetually happy and loyal cat Milk (who is black, despite the name,) who shows up out of nowhere constantly, startling her owners to the point 
        where Janet jokes she can teleport. Soon, they get annoynomous hints from a dubious source claiming they can help find Charlie, and Charlie and the gang are ordered to chase after a McGuffin across country borders after
        a failed heist.

<h2>JUSTICE FOR RANSOM</h2>
<p>Charlie Ackroyd opened his eyes, only to once again greet the barrenness of the small room he had become so familiar with recently. Now, usually, he would immediately react in a panicked tone and maybe shed a few tears, but at this time of night, his brain only understood about a good 10% of what was going on. Which was barely enough to see the tall lean figure perching his foot on the wall in the corner of his eye. Starting to understand again, he could only think a tired “What does he want this time?” 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    The man in front of him was a specimen who could only be described with the word ‘extra.’ 
    <br>
    
    He stood at a large 6’3 frame with clothes reminiscent of a waiter on a doomed high-class voyage from Southampton to New York City, his shoes being pointy enough to stab you in the chin if he ever decided to do an Irish jig 2 feet away from you, and claim powdered sugar was  magically delicious. He sported blonde lochs-aplenty reaching his checked belt. It seemed as though every time Charlie saw the man he was wearing something even more ridiculous than before, this week's special was a red, white, and blue Hawaiian flower necklace and a white fedora with a light red band. 
    <br>
    Or rather, the boy in front of him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    “Hey, sleepy.” He grimaced, cringing. “Sorry bout the recent… influx in requests.” He said looking ashamedly to the left.  Feeling awkward as usual, he tried to change the subject. “So… how’s the ca-” 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    “Cut the crap, Pietro.” Charlie barked, as a new influx in backbone and adrenaline tried to make up for his out-of-whack circadian rhythm. 
    <br>
    “Alright, alright!” Pietro replied, putting his hands up defensively. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    “Whaddya need?” Charlie replied, almost instinctively, the usual fear finally quelling up. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    “Ah, you’re cooperating now.”
    <br>
    Charlie mumbled something under his breath.
    <br>
    “It’s Jack.”
    <br>
    <br>
    Charlie would roll his eyes if he had any current sense of direction, he didn’t know why they still had that kid if he gets caught almost the majority of the time.  Jack's existence made Charlie thankful he had not actually gone to court and defended yet, although if the kid kept that up, that would change. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    “What’d he do this time?” Charlie mirthlessly inquired.
    <br>
    “Bank, local, seen by five guards, wore a bad disguise.”
    <br>
    “How long will it take?” Charlie anxiously replied, nervous about the answer.
    <br>
    “About a week if you wanna get rid of the concrete stuff, extra 2 for circumstantial,” Pietro said, in an apologetic tone. “Sorry, man.”
    <br>
    <br>
    Charlie wanted to snap back with something like “You mean for this, or for kidnapping me and holding me ransom?” but he knew that answer, while it may amuse Pietro, would enrage his father, which would not be good for anyone involved, assuming Jack is still alive at this point. So, he kept quiet and sighed as Pietro made the usual hand motion to the man on the other end of the glass window, and everything went black.
    <br>

    Chapter 2
    <br>
    Float Like A Danifly, Sting Like A Bee
    <br>
    It had been almost a month since Dani last saw her brother. Almost a month after his (hopefully) final graduation. Her mother was still distraught, her sister still apathetic, and her cat still… cat. </p>
