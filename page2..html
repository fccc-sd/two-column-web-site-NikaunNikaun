                As you can likely tell, I wrote this poem when I wasn't doing so hot, so if you aren't ready for that, I
                suggest
                you skip this one.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Memories flow just out of reach.
                <br>
                <br>
                As you reach a distant land
                <br>
                <br>
                Blood-suckling, like a leach
                <br>
                <br>
                Not like what was planned.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Nothing grows within this fog,
                <br>
                <br>
                Not the smallest plant.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I Say I hate this log.
                <br>
                <br>
                “It’s all okay, young man.”
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Many moons have passed since that night.
                <br>
                <br>
                Losing it in stride
                <br>
                <br>
                A life filled with so much fright.
                <br>
                <br>
                I try to stay alive.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                I do not know what I’m fighting.
                <br>
                <br>
                It might be small; it might be grand.
                <br>
                <br>
                All I ask is to keep writing.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this very distant land.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                So, as I make my last reprieve.
                <br>
                <br>
                I hope to see you soon.
                <br>
                <br>
                No matter what I may achieve.
                <br>
                <br>
                It always ends in doom.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                Memories flow just out of reach.

            <h2>Nahyuta</h2>
            <p>The town of Nahyuta’s something to behold. Yet, all of its stories have yet to be told.
                <br>
                So, sit down and rest and sit down and cry. It all started with Sotamoka Kotye.
                <br>
                A young boy he was in this wilderness town. But all the people were just to be found.
                <br>
                You see, he was not born in the caves of Noied, but in the caves he’d suspected they hide.
                <br>
                People thought “Where to next, man? Atlantis?” But they did not believe that he could make it, he
                planned it.
                <br>
                It had been plastered across his village “Sotamoka Kotye, a myth to be pillaged!”
                <br>
                But when he when he saw Nahyuta in all of its glory, he thought pillaging would be far too gory!
                <br>
                Yes, the town was peaceful and that would be evil, it was a big home to many bugs, ants, flies, and
                weevils!
                <br>
                At that moment, out of the cave came several townsfolk feeding beautiful aves. They said “Good sir! Dear
                traveller, coming here was quite brave!”
                <br>
                Sotamoka said “Yes, I was forced to fight snakes, t’was high stakes, none were saved!”
                <br>
                The people of Nahyuta thought “I think he was meant to fail become pale and fall in a grave!”
                <br>
                Quite entranced by his travels the Nahyutians were, but then something odd did sure occur.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Yes, from the trees, and next to the bees, came another traveller, forcing a lion to its knees.
                <br>
                “Stop!” Yelled a native child, young and free. “Let the lion go or taste some fury!”
                <br>
                Sotamoka was confused, this man ran in, he was familiar, he felt in his skin. The lion yelled “Sir,
                please spare!” But then his life was cut short, he nearly missed it by a hair.
                <br>
                The people of Nahyuta were furious at this man, who was he to come in and interfere with nature’s plan?
                <br>
                As the anger erupts, Kotye did soon think, “Who is this man? It’s at my head’s brink.”
                <br>
                But he put it aside as he realized the danger, if only communication was this man’s college major.
                <br>
                The killer of the lion stayed quiet he had. Which angered the townsfolk more than a tad.
                <br>
                Kotye did wonder, what turned this asunder, as he tried to interfere there was a big strike of thunder.
                <br>
                And at that moment there, the silent hunter did speak.
                <br>
                “Ooh! Ah! That lion was weak!”
                <br>
                Recovering from the shock, and the man’s first sentence talked. Kotye did realize this was Mikado Omak.
                <br>
                Yes, the great cryptid hunter, who let no spook go free, was the Holmes with no Watson of Tadopavi.
                <br>
                But quite different, he seemed than how he’s portrayed. He was truly a man who loved to get paid.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Putting no stock in his hometown’s retellings, Kotye soon did start with some yelling.
                <br>
                “Mikado Omak!” Kotye did yell, “ My good sir, how far have you fell?”
                <br>
                Omak turned around “You’re not a fan?” With a face that said “He can kill you. He can.”
                <br>
                Kotye did say “Please stop Omak.”
                <br>
                But he was stopped midway, by aves forming a flock.
                <br>
                He realized quite soon that Omak was hired to make sure the pillage had been transpired.
                <br>
                So, with a heavy heart, Kotye gave up, knowing that even here his town ran amuck.
                <br>
                The Nahyutians did say “Good sir, do not cease!” They said, “We might need you to restore Nahyuta’s old
                peace.”
                <br>
                Now, you may think that he stood up and Omak’s heart grew sizes two.
                <br>
                But I’m sorry to state the fact that that is not true.
                <br>
                Because in that moment was the final known log
                <br>
                Of dialogue spoken in that cave near a bog.
                <br>
                Nobody knows what happened right then.
                <br>
                The state of Nahyuta is now in great decay.
                <br>
                Was this a legend? A Shakespeare play?
                <br>
                We may not find out why it ended that way.
                <br>
                But at least we shan’t repeat the events of that day .
